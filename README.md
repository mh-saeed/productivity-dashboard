## Behind the Scenes: Code Structure and Functionality

The Productivity Dashboard's robust functionality is powered by modern JavaScript practices:

- **Classes**: The dashboard incorporates several classes, including `Dashboard`, `Task`, `Stopwatch`, and `LocalStorageManager`, to ensure code modularity and maintainability.

- **Switch Statements**: Switch statements are used in the "Share Button" functionality to facilitate copying the current URL to the clipboard.

- **Error Handling**: The application uses try-catch blocks for robust error handling. For instance, during dashboard initialization, it attempts to retrieve stored data from local storage. If errors occur or no data is found, default values are gracefully handled.

## Conclusion

This guide helps you navigate the Productivity Dashboard efficiently, outlining its features and explaining how classes, switch statements, and error-handling mechanisms have been seamlessly incorporated for a smooth user experience.
